# Build a Survey Form

**Project:** FreeCodeCamp – Responsive Web Design Certification  
**Date Completed:** January 9, 2026

## Overview
This project is a standards-compliant HTML survey form built as part of the **FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification**. The goal of the project was to create a functional and accessible form that satisfies all required user stories defined by the curriculum.

The form demonstrates proper use of semantic HTML, form controls, labels, validation, and accessibility-friendly attributes, without relying on JavaScript or external libraries.

## Features
- Page title and description using semantic HTML elements
- Accessible form structure with associated `<label>` elements
- Required text and email inputs with HTML5 validation
- Number input with defined minimum and maximum values
- Dropdown (`select`) menu with multiple options
- Grouped radio buttons for single-choice input
- Multiple checkboxes for multi-select input
- Textarea for additional comments
- Submit button to complete the form

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- Native HTML5 form validation (no JavaScript)

## Development Approach
The project was built incrementally by following FreeCodeCamp’s user stories and validation tests. Each form element was added with a focus on correctness, accessibility, and maintainability. The final result passes all automated tests provided by FreeCodeCamp.

The completed project was version-controlled and published to GitHub to demonstrate proper source control practices and project organization.
